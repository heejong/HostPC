Known bugs that require attention by priority level

REQUIRE IMMEDIATE ATTENTION:
# Cannot press back button twice in a row
--- fixed with stack 6/18/13 ---
# Going back from single event modes to calibration screen pops up main menu
--- fixed improper function callback 6/21/13 ---
# expects balanced number of boards (i.e. to make 12, 6 DB into each DUC not 8 DB into one and 4 DB into the other)
### check references to sys_config

# in some modes (definitely test mode 1), double clicking on tree control DB location from MB panel hides all panels
--- fixed missing call from test mode MB & DUC 7/10/13 ---

DO NOT REQUIRE IMMEDIATE ATTENTION:
# When changing panels, size and position are not preserved
### PanelAppearance struct created on first attempt

# Panels are only hidden, wastes memory that might be needed for reading large binary files
### instead, use SavePanelState(), RecallPanelState(), and DiscardPanel()
### or, load panels as children from parent panel rather than loading all as parent panels

# Consider multi-threading analysis to improve performance

# No header file created
### Header struct created to store pertinent information
