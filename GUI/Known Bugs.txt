Known bugs that require attention by priority level

Require immediate attention:
# Cannot press back button twice in a row
--- fixed with stack 6/18/13 ---
# Going back from single event modes to calibration screen pops up main menu
--- fixed improper function callback 6/21/13 ---

Do not require immediate attention:
# When changing panels, size and position are not preserved
# Panels are only hidden, wastes memory that might be needed for reading large binary files
### instead, use SavePanelState(), RecallPanelState(), and DiscardPanel()
### or, load panels as children from parent panel rather than loading all as parent panels
